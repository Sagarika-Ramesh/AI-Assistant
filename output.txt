Deflection,
ILD
is
a
measure
of
the
softness
or
firmness
of
mattress
foam.
If
you
really
want
to
get
technical,
it's
the
amount
of
pressure
needed
to
indent
a
4-inch
piece
of
foam
by
25%.
The
higher
the
ILD,
the
firmer
the
foam.While
you'd
be
unlikely
to
make
a
mattress
choice
based
on
ILD,
it
can
be
useful
as
a
way
of
comparing
how
different
products
might
feel.
This
information
should
be
listed
in

on

an
ILD

top
is
sewn
onto

itself.
A
Euro
pillow
top
(also
called
a
Euro
top),
by
contrast,
has
the
padding
underneath
the
top
cover
and
is
flush
with
the

edges,
so
it
doesn't
look
like
an
extra
layer
sitting

the

addition
to
creating
a
cleaner
look,
the
other
major
benefit
of
a
Euro
pillow
top
is
that,
because
it
is
stitched
underneath
the
cover,
it
won't
shift
or
lose
shape
the
way
a
conventional
pillow
top
can.
Euro

be

Both
provide
the

The
choice
comes
down

mattress
we
add
two
turns
in

3"".
The
support,
comfort,
and

are
exactly
the

on
both
heights
are
the

are
a
couple
of
important
differences
to
note.
The
11.5""
Saatva
Classic
takes
standard
pocket
sheets,
while

14.5""
model
requires
deep
pocket
sheets
like
our
Organic

11.5""
does
not
have
handles,
so
it
would
be
lifted

move
or
shift.
The
14.5""
has
handles
to
assist
in
shifting
but
they
cannot
be
used
to
lift
the
mattress.
If
you're
pairing
your

you
will
need

Short
for
Impression
Load
Deflection,
ILD
is
a
measure
of
the
softness
or
firmness
of
mattress
foam.
If
you
really
want
to
get
technical,
it's
the
amount
of
pressure
needed
to
indent
a
4-inch
piece
of
foam
by
25%.
The
higher
the
ILD,
the
firmer
the
foam.
While
you'd
be
unlikely
to
make
a
mattress
choice
based
on
ILD,
it
can
be
useful
as
a
way
of
comparing
how
different
products
might
feel.
This
information
should
be
listed
in
the
mattress
specs
or
on
the
manufacturer's
website.
Zenhaven's
foams
have
an
ILD
between
14
and
34.
Sometimes
it
takes
a
while
for
you
and
your
new
mattress
to
adjust
to
each
other,
especially
if
it's
a
material
you
haven't
slept
on
before.
That's
why
every
Zenhaven
mattress
comes
with
a
no-pressure,
365-night
home
trial.
Every
Zenhaven
is
dual-sided:
one
side
is
luxury
plush,
the
other
is
gentle
firm.
If
you
prefer
a
different
comfort
level,
simply
flip
the
mattress
over.
If
after
you've
slept
on
your
new
Zenhaven
for
a
few
weeks
you
still
feel
that
it
is
too
soft,
give
us
a
call
at
877-672-2882
and
one
of
our
sleep
guides
will
work
with
you
on
a
solution.All
of
our
mattresses
are
made
to
order
and
arrive
to
you
factory
fresh.
That
means
the
high-quality
materials
inside
them
need
a
little
bit
of
time
to
soften
up.
You
should
notice
your
new
mattress
begin
to
conform
to
your
body
after
a
few
days.
You
may
even
notice
continuing
improvement
for
up
to
a
month.
Remember
that
your
body
will
need
some
time
to
adjust
to
a
brand
new
mattress.
If
you've
been
sleeping
on
an
old
mattress,
your
body
likely
got
used
to
it,
even
if
it
didn't
provide
you
with
adequate
support.
That's
why
we
give
you
a
generous
365-night
home
trial
to
give
you
time
to
acclimate
to
your

It
simply
comes
down
to
choosing
a
rug
size
that
complements
the
size
of
your
bed
and
your
bedroom
layout.
A
queen
size
bed
sits
perfectly
on
an
8’
x
10’
area
rug.
A
king
size
bed
or
two
twin
beds
work
great
on
a
larger
9’
x
12’
rug,
but
you
can
also
go
for
an
extra-large
10’
by
14’
rug
to
accommodate
larger
bedroom
furniture
or
pieces
like
a
bedroom
bench
at
the
end
of
the
bed.A
Cal
king
bed
also
pairs
best
with
a
roomy
10’
x
14’
bedroom
rug.
An
area
rug
under
the
bed
is
the
most
common
placement,
but
depending
on
your
room
size
and
furniture
layout,
you
have
room
to
get
creative!
Placing
an
area
rug
under
your
bed
gives
a
nice
focal
point
to
a
bedroom.
It
instantly
makes
the
space
feel
more
cohesive.
You
can
either
place
the
rug
all
the
way
up
against
the
wall
to
the
headboard,
or
stop
short
of
the
side
tables.
It
depends
on
how
much
space
you
have
and
other
bedroom
furniture
you
want
to
place
over
the
rug.
Bedroom
rugs
are
a
great
way
to
tie
a
bedroom
together.
On
hard
floors,
they
give
your
feet
something
warm
and
soft
to
land
on
and
they
also
help
muffle
downstairs
sounds
in
upstairs
bedrooms.
Look
for
bedroom
rugs
woven
from
soft,
high-quality
fibers
like
PET
yarn,
wool
(or
wool
blends),
and
cotton.
Bedrooms
typically
see
less
foot
traffic
than
living
rooms
or
hallways,
but
a
rug
designed
for
use
in
medium
or
high-traffic
areas
will
ensure
your
bedroom
rug
will
last
for
years
to
come,
even
if
you
decide
to
move
the
rug
to
the
living
room.
Blot
stains
immediately
and
clean
with
mild
soap
and
cold
water.
Blot
dry
with
a

Avoid
prolonged
exposure
to
moisture.
Shedding
is
normal;
vacuum
regularly
with
beater
bar
off,
and
shedding
will
reduce
over
time.
PET
(Polyethylene
terephthalate)
yarn
is
a
type
of
polyester
yarn
made
of
recycled
plastics
such
as
water
bottles.
This
type
of
yarn
is
not
only
a
more
eco-friendly
alternative,
it
also
adds
durability
and
softness
to
natural
materials
like
wool.
All
natural
wool
rugs,
no
matter
the
price
point,
shed
to
some
degree.
The
good
news
is
there
are
ways
to
reduce
shedding,
starting
with
choosing
a
high-quality
wool
rug.
The
higher
the
quality
of
the
wool,
the
less
the
rug
will
shed
overall.
The
amount
of
shedding
also
depends
on
the
way
the
rug
is
crafted.
Lastly,
newer
rugs
tend
to
experience
more
shedding
because
during
the
rug
making
process,
the
fibers
are
cut
down
to
the
desired
pile
height,
leaving
some
pieces
of
fiber
stuck
in
the
rug.
Vacuum
your
wool
rug
regularly
(with
the
vacuum’s
beater
bar
off,
if
possible)
to
reduce
shedding.
You
can
expect
shedding
to
subside
after
a
few
months
with
regular
care
and
vacuuming.
At
this
time
we

not

simply
return
your

A
Murphy
bed
(also
known
as
a
pull-down
bed,
fold-down
bed,
or
wall
bed)
is
a
bed
that
is
hinged
at
one
end
to
store
vertically
against
the
wall,
or
inside
a
closet
or
cabinet.
The

that

frames
are
the
11.5''
Saatva

and
Latex

We
ask
that
you
double-check
the
dimensions
and
the
weight
capacity
of
your
Murphy
bed
frame
to
ensure
that
the
mattress
would
work.
Saatva
offers
two
foundation
heights,
4.75
inches
and
8.75
inches.
There
is
no
difference
in

between
the
two
heights;
the
choice
is
a
matter
of
personal
preference
and
the
overall
height
of
the
bed
setup
you
want.
One
consideration
is
whether
you
plan
to
use
your
existing
bed
skirt.
The
"drop"
on
a
standard
bed
skirt
is
14

Deciding
whether
you
need
a
Saatva
foundation
or
box
spring
for
your
new
mattress
depends
on
the
kind
of
bed
you
plan
on
using
(platform
beds,
for
example,
don't
need
a
foundation),
your
existing
mattress
foundation
or
box
spring,
and
whether
or
not
you
plan
to
use
an
adjustable
base.
You
will
need
the
Saatva
box
foundation
if:
Your
existing
foundation
or
support
system
is
more
than
7
years
old.
Your
existing
support
creaks,
has
soft
spots,
or
is
damaged
in
any
way.
You
want
a
foundation
designed
to
support
your
specific
mattress.
Our
Saatva
HD,
for
example,
requires
pairing
with
our
HD
foundation
for
optimal
support.
You
want
a
foundation
that
matches
your
mattress.
We
use
the
same
organic
cotton
blend
cover
for
the
Saatva
box
foundation
as
we
do
for
our
mattresses.
You
won't
need
the
Saatva
box
foundation
if:
You
purchased
a
mattress
support
system
within
the
last
7
years.
Your
existing
foundation
is
in
good
condition
and
provides
sturdy
center
support.
You
don't
mind
not
having
matching
foundation.
You
have
a
platform
bed,
which
does
not
require
a
foundation.
You
have
an
adjustable
base,
which
takes
the
place
of
a
foundation
or
box
spring.
To
learn
more
about
choosing
the
right
support
system
for
your
mattress,
see
our
article
on
mattress
foundationsYou
can
use
your
existing
box
spring
or
foundation
if:
•
You
purchased
your
box
spring
or
foundation
within
the
last
7
years.
•
Your
existing
box
spring
or
foundation
is
in
good

•
You

Please
make
sure
your
existing

bed
has:
•
A
solid,
durable
surface.
If
your
platform
has
a
slatted
support
system,
make
sure
the
slats
are
spaced
less
than
4"
apart.
If
they're
not,
you
can
add
a
1/2"
thick
piece
of
plywood
to
place
on
top.
This
extra
layer
of
support
is
needed
because
Saatva
mattresses
are
heavier
due
to
their
premium
quality
materials.
•
A
proper
center
support.
Proper
center
support
means
you
must
have
a
center
leg
in
the
middle
of
your
platform
bed
frame.
•
Must
add
a
solid
surface
over
platform
slats
such
as
plywood,
masonite
board,
or
bunkie
board,
when
used
with
Saatva

with

as
long
as
you
keep
some
caveats
in
mind.
Memory
foam
responds
to
heat
and
pressure,
so
placing
a
heating
pad
directly
on
the
mattress
may
compromise
the
foam's
ability
to
contour

body.
Long
periods
of
exposure
to
heat
from
an

or

may
damage

Loom
&

memory
foam
is
infused
with
our
patented
Spinal

gel
for
a
cool
and
comfortable
night's
sleep.
Nontoxic
cooling
gel
is
swirled
throughout
the
top
layer
of
the
mattress,
with
a
higher
concentration
in
the
center
third
lumbar
zone,
to
provide
optimal
spinal
support.
Take
a

look
at
the

Deflection,
ILD
is
a
measure
of
the
softness
or
firmness
of
mattress
foam.
If
you
really
want
to
get
technical,
it's
the
amount
of
pressure
needed
to
indent
a
4-inch
piece
of
foam
by
25%.
The
higher
the
ILD,
the
firmer
the
foam.
While
you'd
be
unlikely
to
make
a

based
on
ILD,
it
can
be
useful
as

of

Hand
tufting
is
a
hallmark
of
a
high-quality
mattress.
It
is
a
method
of
securing
the
layers
by
inserting
a
lace
from
top
to
bottom
while
the
mattress
is
under
compression.
Tufting
keeps
the
layers
in
place
and
prevents
shifting
that
can
ultimately
lead
to
sagging.
It
makes
for
a

has
30
hand
tufts.
The
Saatva
HD
mattress
is
constructed
with
a
single
layer
of
offset
coils.
Like
traditional
mattress
coils,
these
are
shaped
like
an
hourglass,
but
the
bottom
is
slightly
offset.
That
creates
a
hinging
effect
when
the
coil
is
compressed,
making
them
better
able
to
conform
to
the
body's
curves.The

unit
is

12.5-gauge
tempered

the

resistance
to

The

Our
Saatva
Latex
Pillow
is
an
ultra-luxury
pillow
that
offers
the
perfect
balance
of
supportive,
yet
plush
comfort.
Its
design
is
directly
modeled
in
weight
and
quality
of
pillows
found
only
in
luxury
hotels.
Our
unique
3-layer
pillow
is
designed
to
promote
proper
spinal
alignment
for
most
sleep
styles.
The
inner
layer
of
shredded
natural
latex
adjusts
to
almost
any
sleep
position
and
with
our
two
lofts,
we
offer
this
pillow
for
any
sleeper
preference.
Our
Standard
Loft
Saatva
Latex
Pillow
is
4-5"
high
and
excellent
for
back
and
stomach
sleepers
or
anyone
who
prefers
a
lower
pillow.
Our
High
Loft
Saatva
Latex
Pillow
is
6-7"
high
and
ideal
for
side
and
combination
sleepers
or
anyone
who
prefers
a
plusher
pillow.
Our
Down
Alternative
Pillow
is
completely
hypoallergenic
and
specially
designed
to
mimic
the
lofty
feel
of
traditional
down
pillows
with
our
custom
down
alternative
blend
that
offers
both
comfort
as
well
as
durability.
The
Saatva
Down-Alternative
Pillow
is
a
hybrid
construction
using
a
proprietary
blend
of
down-like
micro-denier
fibers
with
a
highly
supportive
polyester
memory
cluster
base.
The
micro-denier
fibers,
which
are
also
used
in
our
Saatva
Pillow,
offer
a
luxuriously
silky
soft,
and
airy
feel
to
the
pillow,
whilethe
memory
clusters
provide
both
a
supportive
base
to
the
pillow,
and
help
ensure
that
the
pillow
retains
its
shape
over
extended
use.
Our
Down
Alternative
Pillow
is
highly
moldable,
meaning
it
suits
most
sleep
styles.
It’s
a
particularly
good
pick
for
people
who
like
to
cuddle
with
their
pillow
at
night.
Our
Graphite
Memory
Foam
Pillow
is
made
of
100%
CertiPUR-US
certified
memory
foam
and
natural
latex
along
with
advanced
graphite
technology
which
draws
heat
away
to
keep
you
cooler
as
the
memory
foam
contours
to
your
head
and
neck
for
responsive
support.
The
Graphite
Memory
Foam
pillow
offers
a
dense,
contouring
support
that's
expected
from
a
memory
foam
pillow
while
providing
unmatched
cooling
as
every
feature
in
this
pillow
has
been
constructed
with
keeping
a
cool
sleep
surface.
Our
uniquely
constructed
memory
foam
pillow
is
designed
to
contour
to
the
head
and
neck
for
optimal
comfort
and
support
in
all
sleep
positions,
and
its
thicker
height
is
particularly
great
for
side
sleepers.
Our
Cloud
Memory
Foam
Pillow
offers
a
specially
engineered
blend
of
shredded
gel-infused
100%
CertiPUR-certified
memory
foam
and
natural
latex
fill.
Shredded
gel-infused
memory
foam
offers
best-in-class
shape-ability
and
contouring
comfort,
while
also
pulling
heat
away
from
the
sleeper's
head,
neck,
and
shoulders,
to
help
the
pillow
feel
temperature
neutral.
The
addition
of
latex
allows
the
pillow
to
be
more
responsive,
breathable
and
helps
retain
its
shape
better
than
other
shredded
memory
foam
pillows
on
the
market.
The
Cloud
Memory
Foam
Pillow
contours
and
conforms
to
your
head
and
neck
in
any
sleep
position.

Mattress
toppers
are
more
substantial
than
mattress
pads
and
protectors,
typically
around
1"
to
4"
in
thickness.
Rather
than
protect
your
mattress,
they're
designed
purely
to
add
an
extra
layer
of
comfort
and
support
to
new
or
older
mattresses.
A
mattress
pad
is
a
thin
quilted
layer
designed
to
protect
your
mattress
from
light
stains
and
general
wear
&
tear.Mattress
protectors
are
thinner
like
fitted
sheets.
They're
primarily
used
to
protect
your
mattress
from
spills
and
humidity,
making
them
a
great
choice
for
kids,
homes
with
pets,
and
humid
climates.
They're
also
great
at
keeping
contaminants
like
mold,
bacteria,
and
bed
bugs
out
of
your
mattress.
Mattress
toppers
are
designed
to
add
a
layer
of
cushioning,
support,
or
softness
to
the
surface
of
a
mattress.

High-density
foam
topper

bit
more
of

feel.
-The
Latex
topper

and
is
meant
to
provide
a
gentle
uplifting
feel.
-The
Micro-coil
topper

of
micro-coils
and

asked!
Due
to
its
high
weight

we
recommend
dry-cleaning

We
use
hypoallergenic
microdenier
fiber
and
hypoallergenic
100%
shredded
Talalay
latex,
all
encased
in
100%
organic
cotton.
The
100%
natural
latex
in
our
Saatva
pillow
is
hypoallergenic.
During
the
manufacturing
process,
the
latex
is
washed
five
times
with
fresh
water,
which
removes
any
of
the
latex
proteins
that
cause
allergies.
Our
three
color
options—white,
ivory,
and
grey—are
in
keeping
with
Saatva's
ethos
of
pure,
organic,
chemical-free
simplicity.

GOTS-certified
organic
sheets

Saatva's
sateen
sheets
are
woven
with

organic
cotton
yarn
using
a
satin
weave

This
method
creates

Thread
count
is
the

inch
of
cotton
fabric.
The

the
thread
count,
the
warmer
the
fabric
becomes.
Our
organic
sateen
cotton
is
made
of
a
300
thread
count
weave,
which
gives
